# Joint Unsupervised Learning (JULE) of Deep Representations and Image Clusters.

This repository contains the source code and resources required to implement and evaluate JULE (Joint Unsupervised Learning of Deep Representations and Image Clusters) algorithm. 

JULE (Joint Unsupervised Learning of Deep Representations and Image Clusters) algorithm is an a recurrent framework proposed in https://arxiv.org/abs/1604.03628.

The sequential operations of a clustering algorithm are formulated as steps in a recurrent process, built upon representations generated by a CNN. 

During training, both image clustering and representation learning are updated simultaneously: clustering occurs in the forward pass, while representation learning takes place during the backward pass. 
The core idea of this framework is that high-quality representations enhance clustering performance, and clustering outcomes provide valuable supervisory signals for learning better representations. By unifying these two processes within a single model and optimizing it end-to-end with a weighted triplet loss, the idea is to achieve both stronger feature representations and more accurate image clusters.
